                                            Fabi and Nellit met like many of the best stories do—not with a dramatic entrance, but with a shared moment that felt like it was leading somewhere. She was planning a surprise birthday party for her good friend. He was just one of the guests—someone she didn’t know, yet from the moment she reached out to invite him, she felt curious. His energy pulled her in: calm, confident, watchful. That night, under string lights in a Miami backyard, she kept catching herself watching him from the corner of her eye.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="fs-xl-5 fs-p-md letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">
                                            They were in different schools, living different lives. And yet, there was a quiet tension between them—familiar yet new. Something magnetic: a slow dance of drawing close, drifting apart, and returning again. There wasn’t a single moment—they drifted toward each other slowly, like the tide pulling in. Subtle glances, shared silences, a pull that deepened before either of them had the words for it.
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="fs-xl-5 letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">
                                        As that summer unfolded, something began to bloom between them: nights on the sand and in the sea, movie marathons that stretched till dawn, 3am Denny’s runs, and beach hangs with mutual friends. Something light-hearted was happening—but underneath it, something else was forming too. Something neither of them expected, but both of them felt.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="fs-xl-5 letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">
                                        They started dating in 2015, when they were still just teenagers—trying to figure out who they were, and who they might become.  From Miami to LA to DC and back to Miami again, what followed was nearly a decade of growing up—sometimes side by side, sometimes stretched across time zones and city lines. There were late-night phone calls and tearful airport goodbyes, semesters apart and seasons of change. But through it all, they kept choosing each other. Quietly, insistently, fully.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="fs-xl-5 letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">
                                        What makes their love work isn’t that they’re the same—it’s that they balance each other. <br>
                                        She asks the deep questions; he brings the steady answers. <br>
                                        He’s the quiet strength; she’s the brilliant storm. <br>
                                        He brings the energy and adventure; <br>
                                        she brings the meaning and magic. <br>
                                        He pushes her toward fun; she pulls him toward feeling. <br>
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="fs-xl-5 letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">They’ve built a love that’s real—fun, deep, and fully their own. It’s been shaped by years of growing up together, learning each other’s rhythms, and choosing to show up again and again. Their relationship is filled with meaning and momentum, laughter and late-night talks, quiet comfort and spontaneous joy. It’s not perfect, but it’s deeply felt—and grounded in a kind of trust that only time can build.</p>

                                        <p class="fs-xl-5 letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">In December 2024, Nellit proposed in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, in a rose-covered amphitheater lit with candles and mariachis beneath the stars. Later that night, he had something even more special planned: a private dinner under the open sky, with a menu curated by a local chef to reflect both of their favorite flavors. Just the two of them, their own waiter, a starlit table, and plenty of mezcal-pepino cocktails to soften the nerves.</p>

                                        <p class="fs-xl-5 letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">Now, nearly ten years after that first time meeting in that backyard party in Miami, they’re getting married in Cartagena—a city as rich and layered as their love. With its colonial churches, faded balconies, crashing waves, and music echoing through cobblestone streets, Cartagena holds space for history, celebration, and soul. It’s the perfect place to begin their next chapter—a place that, like them, holds both stillness and fire. Cartagena was the first corner of Colombia Fabi ever set foot in—Nellit’s country—yet it reminded her of her own: the walled city evoking the charm of Viejo San Juan, the reggaeton, the tropical pulse, the warmth of the coast. Cartagena feels like him, and it feels like her too. The coconut rice, the fried fish, the costeño music. The visits to his grandma, Lela, in nearby Barranquilla. That unforgettable New Year’s Eve when Silvestre Dangond sang by the ocean, moonlight dancing on the waves. And on another visit, something quietly beautiful unfolded: the first time Fabi’s mom tasted costeño flavors and moved to Cartagena’s rhythm—smiling freely on the sand, her joy unguarded. It felt like two families, two cultures, two stories beginning to braid themselves together. Their roots intertwined in joy.</p>

                                        <p class="fs-xl-5 letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-3">It felt only right to return here—to the city where her feet first touched his land, where music and moonlight once wove their worlds together. To celebrate not just what they’ve built, but what they’re still becoming. Cartagena holds all of that. A thousand memories. A thousand beginnings. A love story still unfolding. A promise carved not only beneath the stars, but in years of showing up, of choosing, of believing in something quietly powerful and endlessly worth it.</p>

                                        <p class="fs-xl-5 letter-spacing-15 text-center mb-5">They can’t wait to dance, <br> laugh, and live it all out
                                        <br> with you at their side.</p>
